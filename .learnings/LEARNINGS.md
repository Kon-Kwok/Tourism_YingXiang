## [LRN-20260421-001] correction

### Summary
In this project context, the user's SYCM database should be interpreted as the `qianniu` schema, not a separate `sycm` schema.

### Details
I initially treated `sycm` as a missing MySQL database. The user clarified that their SYCM data is actually stored in the `qianniu` database. Future database inspection and guidance should use that mapping.

### Suggested Action
When discussing this user's database layout, map SYCM-related storage to `qianniu` unless the user states otherwise.

### Resolution

- **Commit/PR**: local workspace
- **Notes**: Promoted the mapping into project guidance so future database inspection treats user-facing SYCM data as the `qianniu` schema.

### Summary
Date-based merge pipelines into `qianniu_fliggy_shop_daily_key_data` need a unique key on `日期` or `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` will not merge sources into one row.

### Details
The workflow combines order-summary data and SYCM flow-monitor data for the same business date. Without a unique constraint on `日期`, both source-specific upserts can create separate rows instead of updating the same row, which breaks the intended daily aggregation behavior.

### Suggested Action
Before relying on date-based upserts for this table, ensure `日期` has a unique key and verify merge semantics against the live schema.

### Resolution

- **Commit/PR**: local workspace
- **Notes**: Promoted the rule into project guidance and aligned the live table schema to use a unique key on `日期`.

### Summary
When running inline MySQL from the shell, avoid backtick-quoted identifiers inside double-quoted command strings because the shell may execute them before MySQL sees the SQL.

### Details
An `ALTER TABLE ... ADD UNIQUE KEY ... (\`日期\`)` command failed because the shell interpreted the backticks. The fix was to send SQL through a single-quoted heredoc so MySQL receives the statement unchanged.

### Suggested Action
For SQL containing backticks or other shell-sensitive characters, prefer `mysql <<'SQL' ... SQL` instead of embedding the SQL directly in a double-quoted shell string.

### Summary
`fliggy-order-list` can intermittently return `success=false` with “订单搜索失败，请稍后再试”; the client should retry instead of treating it as an empty business result.

### Details
During a full end-to-end validation of the six top-level ingestion commands, the order-list pipeline inserted `0 / 0 / 0` into `qianniu_fliggy_shop_daily_key_data`. The root cause was not SQL execution. The upstream HTTP endpoint occasionally returned a business-layer transient failure payload with `success=false`, `errorMsg=订单搜索失败，请稍后再试`, `total=0`, and an empty `orderList`. Reissuing the exact same request against the same date succeeded on later attempts and returned the expected 18 orders. The collector previously normalized this failure payload as if it were a valid empty day, which silently corrupted downstream ingestion.

### Suggested Action
Keep transient-failure retry logic in the order-list client and treat `success=false` business failures as retryable before normalizing the payload.

### Summary
When `sycm flow-monitor` returns `关注店铺人数 = null`, the daily-registration ingestion should coerce it to `0` instead of failing integer conversion.

### Details
During the 2026-04-21 daily run, the flow-monitor payload for `SYCM` returned a single row with every metric set to `null`. The key-data pipeline already normalized that shape to `0` for numeric fields, but `prepare_qianniu_shop_data_daily_registration_sql.py` still treated `None` as an invalid integer and aborted the run. Aligning the registration path with the existing flow-monitor SQL behavior fixed the inconsistency.

### Suggested Action
Treat `None` follow counts as `0` in `prepare_qianniu_shop_data_daily_registration_sql.py` and keep a regression test for the null-input case.

- **Commit/PR**: local workspace
- **Notes**: Null `关注店铺人数` now produces `0` and the top-level yesterday-report skill can finish the daily-registration pipeline.

### Summary
Empty customer-service KPI exports are a valid zero-row business result and should delete that day’s existing rows instead of failing SQL generation.

### Details
During the 2026-04-21 daily run, the `人均日接入` export completed successfully but returned `row_count = 0` and `rows = []`. The SQL generators for `人均日接入`, `客服数据23年新`, and `每周店铺个人数据` previously raised `no customer rows found for insertion`, which treated a valid empty report as an error and blocked the entire yesterday-report workflow. The correct behavior is to consider an empty export authoritative for that date and remove any stale rows for the day.

### Suggested Action
For the three customer-service SQL builders, emit `DELETE ... WHERE date = <biz_date>` when the exported payload has no customer rows, and let the orchestrator treat `COUNT(*) = 0` as a successful validation outcome.

- **Commit/PR**: local workspace
- **Notes**: Empty KPI exports now generate day-scoped deletes and the yesterday-report orchestrator accepts zero-row validation for those three tables.
